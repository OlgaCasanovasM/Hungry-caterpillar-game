## The Very Hungry Caterpiller

#### Description

This game was inspired by the children's book "The very hungry caterpillar" by Eric Carle. In the story, the Caterpillar is very hungry and eats non-stop untill his stomach aches. He then chooses to control his urges and starts eating more greens which eventually gets him to grow, get into a cocoon and become a butterfly.

In the game, the player is the Caterpillar who can eat burgers or brocoli. When eating brocoli he earns points. When eating burgers, his size increases and eventually won't fit in the tunnel anymore and die.

#### Instructions

    1. The Caterpillar starts the game in the center of the tunnel and food starts coming towards him.
    2. The aim of the Caterpillar is to eat as much broccoli as possible given that 1 broccoli = 1 point.
    3. At the same time, he has to avoid the burgers because burgers increase its size.
    4. The Caterpillar dies by crushing against the walls of the tunnel which can happen due to its size after eating too many burgers or while trying to avoid eating them.
